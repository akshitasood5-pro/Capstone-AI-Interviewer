# Progress — PrepPilot

> Keep this a living checklist, not a diary. Check items off as they're genuinely done (built + working, not
> just started). Add new items if scope shifts.

## What works
- **Frontend Scaffolding**: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Lucide icons. Production build verified with 0 errors.
- **Landing Page** (`/`): Modern, high-converting hero, stats, 3 core feature pillars, 4-step workflow, resume report preview, interactive FAQ, responsive navigation & footer.
- **Auth Flow** (`/login`, `/signup`): Authentication pages with candidate/expert role selection and guest/demo flow.
- **Candidate Profile** (`/profile`): Personal info, target role, experience level, target companies, key skill chips, recent reports sidebar, interview cards.
- **Resume Upload & Scanner** (`/resume`): Drag-and-drop PDF upload, target role specification, 4-step animated scanning progression, connected to backend `apiUpload` with client-side fallback.
- **Resume Diagnostic Report** (`/resume/report`): Executive summary, letter grade, radial overall score gauge (0-100), 4-pillar score breakdown (Impact, Technical Depth, ATS Compatibility, Structure & Brevity), detected skills grouped by category, strengths vs areas for improvement, actionable before/after bullet improvement cards with priority badges, and bridge CTA to start mock interview.
- **Backend Core**: FastAPI layered architecture (`api/`, `services/`, `models/`, `schemas/`, `core/`), standard `{ data, error }` response schema, CORS middleware, health check endpoint.
- **Resume Analysis Engine**: PDF extraction via `pypdf`, Gemini Flash integration + Groq fallback + dev mock engine for offline/free-tier resiliency, tested with real PDF payloads.
- **Documentation & Memory Bank**: PrepPilot branding across all documentation, `/memory-bank` persistent context created, `ROADMAP.md` re-sequenced.
